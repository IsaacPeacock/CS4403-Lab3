    "### Issues With the School Columns\n",
    "As can be seen above with the lists and sets I made, there are many different representations of the same school in the school columns. For example the NEST school is shown as NEST, nest, NEST + m, NEST+M, and Nest. There are many other schools that are just like this. This makes it a challenge to find a solution to organize these schools into some sort of numerical format. Also there are times where a number has been put in with no words or letters; this makes it difficult to know what school was meant by this. THere is a PS11 mentioned and there is 11 in the column as well. Is this refering to the same school? It is hard to be certain. You could map each string in the school columns to a int value but then you would have one school with mutiple numeric values. I have decided to leave the schools as there are due to this. There probably is some way to fix this issue but I am unsure on how.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changes I made to Related to the School Columns\n",
    "There was 42 nulls in School Preferences and 88 nulls in School Assigned. I changed the nulls in School Preferences to 0 and the nulls in School Assigned to -1. The reason I did -1 in School Assigned and not 0 is because I found that there was some rows with the string none or None in them showing that the students had no school assigned to them. I felt that they should get the value 0 and not null since they actually show that they don't have a school and null doesn't tell us anything. Looking at the number of nulls in these columns you can see that there is a lot. Because of this, I removed any row that had a null in both the School Preferences and School Assigned columns from the dataframe. I did this because since they are both null we don't know anything about what schools to put the children into so there is no point of having them."
